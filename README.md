#=========================================================

CODE NAME: EPB_2D_CARTESIAN.PY
THIS IS A CODE TO SIMULATE THE DUNAMICS OF EQUATORIAL PLASMA BUBBLE (EPB), PRESENTED BY KHERANI ET AL (2016,10.1063/1.4945636). THE CODE IS WRITTEN IN CARTESIAN COORDINATE IN THE PLANE PERPENDICULAR TO THE GEOMAGNETIC FIELD. 

#=========================================================

CODE NAME: AGWs_2D_CARTESIAN.PY
THIS IS A CODE TO SIMULATE THE DUNAMICS OF ACOSUTIC GRAVITY WAVES, EXCITED FROM A MECHANICAL FORCING AT THE GROUND. tHE EQUATIONS ARE PRESENTED IN KHERANI ET AL (2012, DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-246X.2012.05617.x). THE CODE IS WRITTEN IN CARTESIAN COORDINATE IN THE PLANE (X-Y) IN WHICH X REPRESENTS LONGITUDE OR LATITUDE AND Y REPRESENTS ALTIUDE.
